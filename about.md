Agilist by nature, running and cycling long distances and raising a family in Lancashire

### Who I am

I'm Alex, 30 years old and living on the lumpy frothy edge of the west Pennine Moors in Darwen, Lancashire. I've been a few other things in the past, like a dry stone wall labourer, bartender, sound engineer and web developer. Right now I'm a father, husband, Product Owner, listener of many musics, apple fanboy, maker of flapjacks, and a foodie. One day I would quite like to add Antarctic Explorer to that list, but I'm not there yet.

### What I do

In my job I'm lucky enough to practice SAfE methodology and agile principles with an amazing team who deliver stunning software that helps people [live longer healthier lives](http://emishealth.com).
Running and cycling long distances in extreme weather is what I like to train for and do when I'm not at work.
Here is what I have planned next:

- [The Viking Way Ultra](http://www.vikingwayultra.com) (147 miles) April 1st 2017
