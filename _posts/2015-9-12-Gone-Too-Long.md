title: Family are back tomorrow!

The house will no longer just be a place where I dry out my gear.  
Once again it will be filled with tiny elephant's stomping, with wonderful worldly cuisine, with love, and with a constant and unexplicable rearranging of tins in the cupboard.  

I cant wait to get these guys back again.
